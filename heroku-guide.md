## Deploying slam-mirrorbot on Heroku with Github Workflows.

## Pre-requisites

- [Heroku](heroku.com) accounts
- Recommended to use 1 App in 1 Heroku accounts
- Don't use bin/fake credits card, because your Heroku account will banned

## Deployment

1. Give stars and Fork this repo then upload **token.pickle** to your forks, or you can upload your **token.pickle** to your Index and put your **token.pickle** link to **TOKEN_PICKLE_URL** (**NOTE**: If you didn't upload **token.pickle** uploading will not work). How to generate **token.pickle**? [Read here](https://github.com/breakdowns/slam-mirrorbot#getting-google-oauth-api-credential-file)

2. Go to Repository `Settings` -> `Secrets`
